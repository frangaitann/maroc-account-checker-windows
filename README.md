# maroc-account-checker-windows

The same tool of the original maroc, used for checking working accounts of streamint platforms but adapted for Windows.

------

This program was made for checking if an individual account or a group of them are active (The credentials are correct) or if not.

There isn´t too much difficulty for use it, if you are going to use the Automatic Mode you must have an "accounts.txt" file in the same folder that the program is saved, it must contain the accounts in the next format (one account per line)

email:password

------

V1.0 - 12/12/2022

-It works with HBO Max (Just with the English Language Page)

-Works with firefox and geckodriver (firefox not included in requirements.txt)

------

i´m not responsible about where you obtain the accounts that are being checked or if you use the program with a bad intention.
